# MusicAPP
*My VERY first Music App with PURE HTML5,  CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript!!!* 

A highly customisable Music APP with fluid and smooth butter-like page transition effects, search filters, adding to liked list, play liked list, shuffle, repeat one or all or none, BGsurprise toggle, highly customisable super butter-like settings, and many many many more. It is an App for anime Songs!

## **Technologies Used:**
*HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest, git*


## How to install and run on your PC?
First, clone the repo. Then open the index.html with Live Server. Then enjoy the APP.

## How to add more songs?
First, upload the song on the SONGS folder. Then, upload an image of the song in the IMAGES folder. Then open SONGS.JSON and see how other songs are structured.

In the SONGS.JSON, add a name. I'd prefer a Japanese name. Then the image and song url. Also specify the duration of the song. Then add some search key words. Users can filter the songs with these key words. It will filter instantly as they press any letter key.

That's all you need to do to add a new song. If you want, you can create pull requests by adding new songs. I'll merge it if you followed all the instructions.

Enjoy!
